# Flu-Data-Collection-and-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-R-

- Actual data from government related to flu epidemic in 2018(January) was collected from https://www.cdc.gov/flu/ and 
  the intensity was plotted using a heat map of USA
- Data from twitter(tweets) was collected during that time and the intensity of words related to flu was plotted on a heat map.
- I tried to find out whether there were any relations between the actual data and the data from twitter and tried to predict 
  whether people in social media were more active about flu if that region was affected by flu.
